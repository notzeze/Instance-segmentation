Object detection and semantic segmentation combined into instance segmentation is prevalent for various computer vision use cases, like autonomous vehicles and intelligent
transportation systems(ITS). In this research, we investigate the
effectiveness of state-of-art deep learning algorithms such as
Mask R-CNN and Detectron2 adopting a custom selection from
the Mapillary Vistas Dataset.
